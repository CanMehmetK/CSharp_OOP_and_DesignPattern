As Christopher Alexander said:
Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment,
and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can
use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice.


in Professional ASP.NET Design Patterns Book / Scott Millett says;
What They Are Not
Design patterns are no silver bullet. You have to fully understand your problem, generalize it, and
then apply a pattern applicable to it. However, not all problems require a design pattern. It’s true
that design patterns can help make complex problems simple, but they can also make simple problems
complex.
